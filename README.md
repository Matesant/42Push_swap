<h1 align="center">Sort your stacks!</h1>

This repository contains the implementation of the first sorting algorithm in the 42 curriculum.

## About
The project involves developing an algorithm to sort two stacks, a and b, with the minimum number of movements possible.

## Requirements
The functions are written in __C language__ and need the `gcc` compiler.

## Instructions

### 1. Compiling the archives

To compile the project, go to its path and run:

For __mandatory__ :
```
$ make
```
### 2. Cleaning all binary (.o) and executable files (.a)

To delete all files generated with make, go to the path and run:
```
$ make fclean
```
## Bonus
The bonus involves developing a checker to validate the output of the push swap program. This tool verifies that the sorting algorithm produces the correct results by ensuring that the final order of elements in the stacks meets the expected criteria.

To compile the bonus:

For __bonus__ :
```
$ make bonus
```

## Testing
This project have been tested with (https://github.com/gemartin99/Push-Swap-Tester).
